# About Dataset
## Context
I am a huge football fan and football statistics fascinate me. This data helps you to understand who is really who in the world of football. After discovering the understat.com platform with extended analytics about every single game in top European leagues I started to understand football even more. So I decided to scrape available summary data to take a look at some numbers of all teams of all leagues that not many people go for.

## Content
The dataset contains statistical summary data by the end of each season from 2014 for 6 UEFA Leagues:

La Liga

EPL

BundesLiga

Serie A

Ligue 1

RFPL

## Parameters
position, team, amount of matches played, wins, draws, loses, goals scored, goals missed, points.

# Analytical Process
- Analyze performance trends of football clubs based on various statistical parameters provided in the dataset.
- Identify key factors contributing to club performance across different UEFA leagues, including wins, losses, goals scored, and points.
- Segment clubs by their performance profiles to understand the characteristics of top, mid-level, and lower-ranked teams.
- Evaluate correlations between different performance metrics and explore relationships among clubs using techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
- Apply clustering methods (K-Means and CAH) to group clubs with similar performance characteristics and establish typical performance profiles.
- Provide actionable insights for fans, analysts, and team managers to understand trends and strategies for improving club performance across UEFA leagues.
