# About Dataset
## Context
I am a huge football fan and football statistics fascinate me. This data helps you to understand who is really who in the world of football. After discovering the understat.com platform with extended analytics about every single game in top European leagues I started to understand football even more. So I decided to scrape available summary data to take a look at some numbers of all teams of all leagues that not many people go for.
